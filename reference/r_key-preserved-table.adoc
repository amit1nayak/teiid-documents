= Key-preserved Table

A key-preserved table has a primary or unique key that would remain unique if it were projected into the result of the query. Note that it is not actually required for a view to reference the key columns in the SELECT clause. The query engine can detect a key preserved table by analyzing the join structure. The engine will ensure that a join of a key-preserved table must be against one of its foreign keys.
