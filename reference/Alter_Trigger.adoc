= Alter Trigger

Usage:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER TRIGGER ON name INSTEAD OF INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE (AS FOR EACH ROW block) | (ENABLED|DISABLED)
----

Syntax Rules:

* The target, name, must be an updatable view.

* Triggers are not yet true schema objects. They are scoped only to their view and have no name.

* An link:Update_Procedures_Triggers.adoc[Update Procedures (Triggers)] must already exist for the given trigger event.

NOTE: If the default inherent update is chosen in Teiid Designer, any SQL associated with update (shown in a greyed out text box) is not part of the VDB and cannot be enabled with an alter trigger statement.
