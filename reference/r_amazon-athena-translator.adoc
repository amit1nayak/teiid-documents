= Athena translator (athena)

The Amazon Athena translator, known by the type nameÂ _athena_, is for use with the Amazon Athena service. 

The translator is effectively an extension of the link:r_prestodb-translator.adoc[PrestoDB] translator, but accounts for some of the known limitations of Athena.  It is generally been used with a source created with the Simba Athena driver.
