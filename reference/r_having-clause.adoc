= HAVING Clause

The HAVING clause operates exactly as a WHERE clause although it operates on the output of a GROUP BY. It supports the same syntax as the WHERE clause.

Syntax Rules:

* Expressions used in the group by clause must either contain an aggregate function: COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX. or be one of the grouping expressions.
